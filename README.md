# camt.053-to-YNAB
Your Swiss bank can't communicate directly with YNAB (yet). But it does offer you the option of exporting all your transactions in 'camt.053' files. You can use this tool to convert these files into a YNAB-friendly file format.

100% of the processing is done in plain vanilla JS, therefore only on the client's terminal. No privacy issues, no storage required, heck not even a fancy React back-end... It's just plug and play.
